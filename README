Minargon - Detector Monitoring for VST
============================================

Minargon is a fork of Minard for SBND/the VST.

Quickstart
----------

To run a local copy of minargon, first create a virtual environment and activate
it.

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate

Now, clone the minard repository, and install the prerequisites:

    $ git clone https://github.com/gputnam/minargon.git
    $ cd minargon
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Minargon needs a configuration file to run with the settings of where
the Redis Database is located. An example settings file is given in
`example_settigns.conf`. Either use those settings, or make a new
settings file (if your database in a different location). Then set:

    $ export MINARD_SETTINGS=your_settings_file.conf

    $ export MINARD_SETTINGS=`pwd`/settings.conf

Now, you can start up the webserver:

    $ ./runserver.py

And you should be able to open your web browser to localhost:5000 and see it.

Note that if you are running on a remote server, you will have to
forward port 5000 back to your laptop in order to view the website. To
do this, when ssh-ing into the remote server, add in the parameter: `-L
5000:localhost:5000`.

This is the SBND variant, ported by A. Mastbaum and Gray Putnam.
